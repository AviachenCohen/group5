                    How does stress and anxiety affect the skin of the face and body?
                </h3>
                <p> It is known that the skin is one of the organs through which it is possible to discover what is
                    going on inside our body. Researchers have found that there is a direct and clear effect between
                    stress and skin reaction. In the last few days when the stress and anxiety are increasing, some
                    of us can already see some symptoms that have started to appear on the surface of the skin. For
                    example, one of the chronic inflammatory skin diseases that break out in these times is
                    seborrhea, about 15% of the population suffers from this common phenomenon.

                <h3>
                    With or without aluminum - is it really dangerous?
                </h3>
                <p> Medical studies show that aluminum can accumulate in the body and at the same time, there is
                    no scientific evidence that directly links aluminum to certain health conditions, but in
                    subjective cases of people suffering from serious chronic diseases.

                    There are cases where the use of deodorant containing aluminum chloride may cause
                    irritation. why is it happening? Because during use, the molecules that make up the aluminum
                    are absorbed by the skin, which can cause the sweat glands to be blocked to the point of
                    completely preventing sweating, which can cause irritation and allergy.

                    Sensitive and red skin
                </h3>
                <p> The facial area has thin, delicate skin that is exposed to the elements of the weather and
                    the environment. Therefore, the skin tends to be particularly sensitive and dry out quickly.
                    Redness in the facial skin is due to skin sensitivity and extreme dryness of the skin, which
                    causes a reddish color in the skin, accompanied by facial skin irritation. Redness in the
                    face can sometimes also be accompanied by peeling of the facial skin, which indicates that
                    the skin is in distress and needs soothing and lots of moisture. Unprotected exposure to the
                    sun and using products that are not suitable for your skin can also irritate the skin and
                    cause redness.
