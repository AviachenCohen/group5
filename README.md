# GlowGuide Client-Side Application

This part of the project is the client-side implementation of the GlowGuide website, which provides personalized
skincare recommendations to users based on the details they provide, as well as links to websites that offer the
relevant products.

## 1. Creating Pages - HTML

- Six HTML pages were created to represent different screens of the application.
- Each page includes a header with a navigation bar for easy navigation across the site.

## 2. Designing Pages - CSS

- CSS files were utilized to design the application with responsiveness.
- CSS animations were incorporated to enhance user experience, such as animations on the main image and navbar titles.

## 3. Dynamic Implementation of Website JavaScript

- Eight JavaScript files were created for dynamic functionality, each focusing on specific events or interactions.
- Event functions were implemented to handle user interactions, such as button clicks, object visibility and search
  history*.

## 4. Implementation of Service Functionality on the Client Side

- The client-side service functionality includes collecting and validating user inputs through forms.
- Forms were implemented for various purposes, such as user registration, login, profile updates, and product search.

## 5. General Instructions

- **Working Assumptions**: Certain assumptions were made to meet project guidelines, clearly specified in the project
  documentation comments.

1. *not all required functionality is in the search history event because a connection to a database is required which
   will happen in step C, but this is the basis for this page and step.
2. On the "my skin care" screen, when you click on one of the images describing categories of care products,
   a section containing the products in that category will open below them. Clicking on another image changes it to
   products under the new category. At this stage we applied the click only on the cleansers and moisturizers
   categories, because after connecting to a database all the products will be displayed **according to the user details
   **, and therefore we will not enter them manually at this stage, but we did want to show the functionality that will
   be used by the customer in the above object.

## 6. Additional Information

- The project's GitHub repository contains all files related to the implementation of the client-side application.
- Each JavaScript file is dedicated to specific functionalities or screens, promoting clean and organized code
  structure.
